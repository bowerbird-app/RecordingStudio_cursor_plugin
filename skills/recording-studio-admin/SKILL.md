# Recording Studio admin

**Recording Studio Admin** is staff operations UI. Access is **Accessible** (`recording-studio-access`) — do not copy that skill’s install here. Page shape: `recording-studio-ui`. Words: `recording-studio-text`.

Install Accessible first, then this gem. Admin is one **mount point**. Other gems often ship a user slice *and* a separate admin slice.

## Admin root, not nominated admins

Do not set `user.admin = true`.

1. Create an **admin root** (a normal root — for example `AdminRoot`).
2. Mount admin **under that root**.
3. Grant Accessible access to that root (`grant_access`). Whoever can access it can use the admin UI, subject to roles.

Host app authenticates. Admin authorizes against a mandatory **access recording** (usually the admin root) with `RecordingStudioAccessible.authorized?`. If Accessible cannot express the policy, **stop and ask**.

Keep three concerns separate:

1. **Access recording** — which recording gates this mount
2. **Enabled sections** — which registered sections appear for the current recordable type
3. **Section recordable** — optional object created after a section opens

## Install Admin

```bash
bin/rails generate recording_studio_admin:install
bin/rails generate recording_studio_admin:admin_root   # optional host scaffolding
```

```ruby
gem "recording_studio_admin"

mount RecordingStudioAccessible::Engine, at: "/admin/access"
recording_studio_admin_for :admin, at: "/admin", root_section: :root

RecordingStudioAdmin.configure do |config|
  config.default_mount_path = "/admin"
  config.authentication_method = :authenticate_user!
  # Host auth identifies the actor. This gem’s hook is current_actor_method
  # (often :current_user). Some hosts set Current.actor instead.
  config.current_actor_method = :current_user
  config.access_recording_resolver = ->(context) {
    context.controller.current_admin_root_recording
  }
end
```

Fail closed: missing auth → `401`; missing access recording or Accessible denial → `403`. Default gate is Accessible `:view` before sections, widgets, or screen queries.

Enable sections on the admin root recordable:

```ruby
class AdminRoot < ApplicationRecord
  include RecordingStudio::Recordable
  include RecordingStudioAccessible::AllowsAccessibleChildren
  include RecordingStudioAdmin::AllowsAdminSections

  recording_studio_recordable label: "Admin", root: true
  recording_studio_accessible_children :access

  recording_studio_admin_sections do
    section :root
    section :webhooks
  end
end
```

Use the Accessible enablement API from `recording-studio-access` / that gem’s README — do not assume every mixin uses `enable_capability`.

## Screens and widgets

Keep definitions in `app/admin` and load them from `to_prepare`.

```text
app/admin/
  manifest.rb
  webhooks/
    manifest.rb
    section.rb                 # hub + maybe “failed last 24h”
    failed_deliveries/
      screen.rb
      table.rb
```

| Kind | Job |
|---|---|
| **Section** | Hub: links + a few signals |
| **Screen** | One operational job: filter, table, maybe a chart |
| **Widget** | Card that changes what someone does next (`number`, `list`, `chart`, `progress`). Extra-info when the title is not obvious (`recording-studio-text`) |
| **Resource** | Table actions; host owns the mutation controller |

```ruby
context.admin_screen_path("failed_deliveries")
context.admin_section_path("webhooks")
```

## Useful widgets, not filler

Empty space is fine. Do not add a widget per model or a screen per table.

Ask: what does staff **notice, decide, or fix**? If removing the widget would not change an action, delete it.

| Worth a widget | Rarely |
|---|---|
| Failed deliveries in 24 hours | Total webhooks ever |
| Invites waiting | Total users |
| Jobs stuck | A second chart of the same count |
| Usage vs plan | “Activity” with no decision |

**List** of work beats a vanity number. Do not repeat the same fact as number + chart + list.

A **section** is two to four signals plus links. A **screen** is one job (failed deliveries). A gem’s admin slice answers **that gem’s** operational questions — not a tour of the database.

Newcomer check: can they tell what needs them? Cryptic number → extra-info, not three more widgets.

## Wiring checklist

1. Actor can authenticate (`authentication_method`).
2. Current actor resolves (`current_actor_method` / `Current.actor` — host choice).
3. `access_recording_resolver` returns a real recording.
4. That recordable enables the needed sections.
5. Actor has Accessible access on that recording (usually `:view`).
6. Site-wide blast-radius screens: `site_admin_recording_resolver`.

## Guardrails

- Use Admin’s Flatpack rendering. Queries in definitions or services, not ERB.
- Exhaust belongs in **logs** (`recording-studio-data-shape`).
- Mutations: `RecordingStudioAdmin.authorize_resource!` and `perform_recording_studio_admin_action!`.
- Grant on the **admin root**, not a broad workspace grant to unlock one page.

Canonical: Admin README, `docs/gem_template/ADMIN_SCREENS.md`, dummy `test/dummy/app/admin`.
